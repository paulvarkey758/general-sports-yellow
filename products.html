Our VRS impact-absorption platforms reduce sound and bounce caused by dropping barbells during Olympic lifts, protecting floors, bars, weights, and plates from hard use. The multi-layer design minimizes vibrations transferred through floors, essential for above-ground training facilities, and the low platform height allows easy accessibility. VRS Platform kits are available in a variety of styles and sizes, so it’s easy to upgrade existing Matrix platforms or create a rugged new training experience." alt="">
